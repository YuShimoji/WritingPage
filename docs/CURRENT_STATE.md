# Current State

最終更新: 2026-06-28（Heading shortcut first-line boundary fix）

## Snapshot

### 2026-06-28 Heading shortcut first-line boundary fix

- Followed up the Rich editing typed heading shortcut after user observation separated the now-fixed Electron IME underline residual from a first-line `#` + Space shortcut gap.
- Product-facing change: typed heading shortcut detection now accepts a direct root text node in the freshly opened empty Rich editing surface, so first-line `#` + Space converts to an empty H1 just like the paragraph/div-backed later-line path. Existing `P` / `DIV` block handling remains unchanged.
- Visual classification: the black horizontal line after successful `#` + Space conversion is app-owned H1 CSS (`#wysiwyg-editor h1` border-bottom via `--heading-h1-border-bottom`), not native IME or spellcheck underline.
- Focused proof in `e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js` adds the initial empty first-line scenario while preserving existing heading shortcut positive/negative, IME composition guard, native spellcheck-off, and Undo coverage.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-28/heading-shortcut-first-line-boundary.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-28 Electron IME underline persistence fix

- Followed up the Rich editing IME repaint slice after the browser path was covered but Electron could still leave a thin native underline after Japanese IME confirmation.
- Product-facing change: `#wysiwyg-editor` now has native spellcheck disabled at the HTML surface and in `RichTextEditor.init()`, and `compositionend` re-applies that guard before the existing paint-only repaint tick. This targets the Electron contenteditable native decoration cache without rewriting editor HTML, Markdown, selection, storage, Undo state, typed heading shortcut behavior, or rich text decoration persistence.
- Focused proof in `e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js` keeps the prior synthetic IME repaint test and adds a Rich editing native spellcheck-off assertion for the contenteditable surface.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-28/electron-ime-underline-persistence-fix.md`.
- Native OS IME painting remains a manual Electron visual remainder if final packaged confirmation is needed; BrowserWindow/package settings and the textarea spell checker were not changed.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-28 IME underline repaint fix

- Returned to Rich editing input UX after a user-observed Japanese IME visual artifact: after IME confirmation, a thin composition underline could remain until another app repaint such as click/sidebar refresh.
- Product-facing change: `compositionend` now schedules a paint-only repaint tick on `#wysiwyg-editor` through a temporary `data-ime-repaint` attribute. This is intentionally non-data: it does not rewrite editor HTML, Markdown, selection, storage, Undo state, typed heading shortcut behavior, or rich text decoration persistence.
- Focused proof in `e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js` covers synthetic IME composition end, verifies the repaint hook runs, and asserts content/selection/composition state remain intact. Native OS IME painting remains a manual visual remainder if final confirmation is needed.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-28/ime-underline-repaint-fix.md`.
- Closed lanes remain closed unless new evidence appears: launcher, effect settings wording, Markdown source dev gate, WP-005, Project import recovery, Rich heading, and Rich text block align persistence.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-26 One-click update launcher

- Added a Windows-friendly normal confirmation route after the effect settings wording slice: `ZenWriter-UpdateAndLaunch.cmd` and `npm run app:update:open` update the current branch with fast-forward only, rebuild `dist/`, and open `dist/index.html` through the existing dist launcher.
- Added `npm run app:install:update`, which creates a Start Menu shortcut named `Zen Writer Update and Launch` without replacing the existing `Zen Writer.url` quick-open shortcut.
- Safety boundary: the update path checks for a clean worktree before pulling, uses `git pull --ff-only`, stops on local changes / detached HEAD / non-fast-forward update, and does not discard work.
- Launch boundary: normal confirmation remains `dist/` / default app open, dev server stays explicit development/localhost, and Electron packaged verification remains separate.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-26/one-click-update-launcher.md`.
- Closed lanes remain closed unless new evidence appears: WP-005, Project import recovery, Rich heading, Rich text block align, Markdown source dev gate, and effect settings wording.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-26 Effect settings writer-facing wording audit

- Returned to the command palette / settings clarity lane after the dead-entry sweep produced no code changes. Scope stayed only on `effectBreakAtNewline` / `effectPersistDecorAcrossNewline` visible wording.
- Product-facing change: command palette and UI Settings now describe the two newline effect toggles as writer actions: `改行後の装飾を切る` and `改行後も装飾を続ける`. Visible descriptions explain whether Enter carries current decoration into the next line instead of exposing `decor`, `BL-002`, or storage key names.
- Storage keys, command ids, defaults, settings persistence, and rich editing Enter behavior are unchanged.
- Focused proof in `e2e/command-palette.spec.js` and `e2e/editor-settings.spec.js` asserts the writer-facing labels and verifies the visible text no longer includes the internal implementation terms.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-26/effect-settings-writer-facing-wording-audit.md`.
- Closed lanes remain closed unless new evidence appears: command palette dead-entry sweep, Markdown source dev gate, WP-005 preview/comparison, Project import recovery, Rich heading, and Rich text block align persistence.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 Remote sync after Markdown source authority reconciliation

- Local `main` was checked against `origin/main` after `git fetch origin`; before this handoff commit the tree was clean, `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, and the latest pushed context was `8db12aa docs: reconcile markdown source authority`.
- This handoff preserves the current restart context in project files only. Product/runtime behavior remains the command palette Markdown source dev gate from `210246c`, with the active authority reconciliation from `8db12aa`.
- Current restart anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/remote-sync-after-markdown-source-authority.md`.
- Closed lanes remain closed unless new evidence appears: WP-005 preview/comparison, Project import recovery, Rich heading, Rich text block align persistence, and Markdown source dev gate implementation.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 Active authority Markdown source dev gate reconciliation

- Followed the `210246c fix: gate markdown source command` product proof with a bounded active-authority residue audit. No runtime behavior changed.
- Reconciled current UI authority wording so normal writing routes point to Rich editing / MD preview / Reader, while Markdown source is named as a developer-mode escape hatch.
- Updated the active UI model / surface docs only: `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`, `docs/UI_SURFACE_AND_CONTROLS.md`, `docs/GADGETS.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Historical dated logs and superseded specs were left intact.
- Verification anchor remains `docs/verification/2026-06-25/command-palette-markdown-source-dev-gate.md`, now including the authority reconciliation notes.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 Command palette Markdown source dev gate

- After Rich text block align persistence, selected a fresh one-topic product slice from editor surface / command palette clarity rather than reopening WP-005, Project import recovery, Rich heading, or paragraph alignment.
- Product-facing change: `editor-surface-markdown` is now a developer-mode command. Normal command palette search no longer offers a Markdown source switch that the app then refuses; developer mode still exposes the escape hatch with wording that names the developer-mode boundary.
- Focused proof in `e2e/command-palette.spec.js` stubs the developer-mode check false, searches `Markdown ソース`, verifies the command is absent, then stubs developer mode true and verifies the command returns with the developer-mode description.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/command-palette-markdown-source-dev-gate.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 Rich text block align persistence

- After WP-005 A/B/C closed, selected a fresh one-topic product slice from the rich editing / save-resume trust lane rather than reopening preview/comparison, Project import recovery, or Rich heading.
- Product-facing change: Rich editing CommandAdapter edits now commit through the editor change path after successful commands, so paragraph alignment syncs to Markdown, saves, updates word count, and refreshes MD preview instead of remaining a visual-only DOM edit.
- `ZWMdItBody` now preserves the narrow `data-zw-align="start|center|end"` block fragments used by P2 paragraph alignment without enabling arbitrary raw HTML. The aligned block body is rendered through the existing inline Markdown renderer before restoration.
- Focused proof in `e2e/rich-text-block-align.spec.js` now aligns a paragraph, verifies saved Markdown content, checks MD preview and Reader `text-align`, reloads, and confirms the aligned paragraph returns in Rich editing.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/rich-text-block-align-persistence.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 WP-005 comparison isolation Slice C

- Completed WP-005 Slice C after Slice A entry cleanup and Slice B MD preview activation. Scope stayed on comparison isolation, not a new comparison UI.
- Product-facing boundary: command palette no longer carries hidden executable `compare-chapter` / `compare-snapshot` routes, structure sidebar wording no longer promises comparison, and MD preview / Reader do not open SplitView.
- `js/split-view.js` remains as future comparison-surface material, explicitly marked as out of public MD preview / Reader / command flows. Future comparison work should start as a dedicated comparison/file-comparison surface rather than reusing preview or Reader.
- Focused proof in `e2e/ui-mode-consistency.spec.js` now searches `compare`, `比較`, and `差分`, verifies no comparison commands/categories appear, and checks that opening MD preview / Reader leaves `#split-view-container` hidden.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/wp005-comparison-isolation-slice-c.md`.
- WP-005 readiness is now closed for the A/B/C cleanup lane. The next product slice should be chosen from a fresh bottleneck; do not reopen comparison unless a dedicated comparison-surface brief or new failure appears.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 WP-005 MD preview rich-preview activation

- Continued WP-005 after Slice A without reopening Project import recovery or Rich heading. Scope stayed on Slice B: MD preview visibility / rich-preview activation proof, not comparison redesign.
- Product-visible change: `#editor-preview` is no longer caught by the generic offscreen `[aria-live]` CSS rule. The panel had been opening and rendering, but could be positioned as an accessibility-only live region instead of a visible editor-adjacent preview.
- Existing preview controller path in `js/editor-preview.js` remains the runtime authority: opening/rendering MD preview calls `TypingEffectController.activate()` and `ScrollTriggerController.activate()` for `#markdown-preview-panel`.
- Added focused proof in `e2e/wp005-md-preview-rich-preview.spec.js`: command palette opens MD preview, rich Markdown/DSL output renders, content updates refresh the preview while open, typing/scroll controllers activate, Reader overlay stays closed, and SplitView stays hidden.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/wp005-md-preview-rich-preview-activation.md`.
- At the time, the next WP-005 candidate was Slice C. Slice C is now closed by the current snapshot above; do not fold chapter compare or snapshot diff back into the MD preview surface.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 WP-005 preview entry Slice A

- Started WP-005 after closing Project import recovery continuation. Scope stayed on Slice A only: preview/comparison entry cleanup, not full preview redesign.
- Product-visible change: stale public split-view comparison entry points were removed from the structure sidebar and Electron menu, while command palette comparison commands were hidden. `js/split-view.js` remains available as future comparison implementation material, not a current public writing workflow entry.
- Current entry model: MD preview is still the editor-adjacent rendering panel, Reader is still the read-only review overlay, and comparison is deferred to a future WP-005 Slice C instead of sharing public preview entry space.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/wp005-preview-entry-slice-a.md`.
- At the time, the next WP-005 candidate was Slice B. Slice B is now closed by the current snapshot above; Slice C remains comparison isolation and should not be folded into MD preview work.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-25 Project import recovery continuation proof

- Returned to the Editor Trust / Project Recovery follow-up requested after `0c21466 feat: clarify failed project import recovery`.
- Product implementation did not need a fix. The focused proof in `e2e/editor-trust-workflow.spec.js` now covers invalid JSON import on the normal document path, safe-failure notification, unchanged current doc id / raw id / docs snapshot, continuation writing, saved state, reload, and restored continuation text.
- The chapter-mode part of the same E2E still keeps invalid import scoped to non-mutation of chapter parent/raw id/docs before the JSON import roundtrip proof. This avoids treating assembled chapter display as a single freeform save surface.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-25/project-import-recovery-continuation-proof.md`.
- Current next work is no longer `project-import-recovery-continuation-proof`; choose a fresh one-topic bottleneck from the ledger/roadmap instead of reopening Project import recovery or Rich heading without new evidence.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-24 Remote sync after project import safe failure

- Local `main` was checked against `origin/main` after `git fetch --prune origin`; `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Current product proof before this docs-only handoff is `0c21466 feat: clarify failed project import recovery`.
- Supervisor review accepted `project-import-safe-failure-signal`: failed JSON project import now tells the writer that the current document is retained, while the focused E2E still proves invalid import does not mutate current doc id / raw id / docs snapshot.
- This handoff preserves restart context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/verification/2026-06-24/remote-sync-after-project-import-safe-failure.md`.
- Next bounded product entry: `project-import-recovery-continuation-proof` — after invalid JSON import failure, prove the current editor remains usable, a continuation text can be written, and reload/resume preserves that continuation.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-06-24 Project import safe failure signal

- Returned to an Editor Trust product slice after Rich heading closure. Selected axis: Project Recovery / failed JSON import recovery signal.
- Product-visible change: failed JSON project imports now notify `JSON読み込みに失敗しました。現在の文書は保持されています。` through the Documents import path, drag/drop JSON import path, and Electron menu import path.
- Existing storage behavior is unchanged: invalid JSON import still returns `null` without mutating the current document set. The focused E2E now checks the retained-document message and continues to assert current doc id / raw id / docs snapshot invariance.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-24/project-import-safe-failure-signal.md`.
- Non-targets preserved: Rich heading, import/export schema, cloud sync, external DB/auth/API, Electron packaging behavior, broad docs cleanup, GitHub cleanup, and AGENTS rules.

### 2026-06-24 Rich heading active docs reconciliation

- Local `main` was checked against `origin/main`; `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0` before this docs-only reconciliation.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-24/rich-heading-active-docs-reconciliation.md`.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` now points to the Rich heading closure checklist and placeholder/caret polish proof in its active header / writing trust lane, so the next agent should not return to the older IME / direct shortcut / placeholder review loop.
- Product/runtime state is unchanged. No implementation, E2E, dependencies, storage/import/export, Electron/package, GitHub cleanup, DB/auth/API, or AGENTS behavior changed.
- Next practical entry: choose one current product slice from `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, audit active-doc drift only where it can mislead the next owner, or run an optional release-wide visual check as confidence work rather than a blocker for Rich heading.

### 2026-06-22 Remote sync after Rich heading closure

- Local `main` was checked against `origin/main` after `git fetch --prune origin`; there were no new remote commits to pull, `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Pre-handoff baseline commit before this docs-only note was `24ca99e docs: add rich heading closure checklist`. This handoff records the current restart context without changing product/runtime behavior.
- This pass preserves restart context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/verification/2026-06-22/remote-sync-after-rich-heading-closure.md`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-22/remote-sync-after-rich-heading-closure.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Rich heading context is closed enough to avoid repeat review: use `docs/verification/2026-06-22/rich-heading-feature-closure-checklist.md` before asking about IME / direct shortcut / placeholder again. Current classification remains functionality accepted, placeholder UX debt resolved, optional release visual check not blocking.
- Product/runtime state is unchanged by this handoff. Latest editor product proof remains WP-SAVELOAD-001 / `writing-trust-workflow-001`; the next practical entry is stale spec reconciliation or another explicitly selected one-topic slice.

### 2026-06-22 Rich heading closure checklist

- Added a docs-only closure checklist for the Rich editing typed heading shortcut: `docs/verification/2026-06-22/rich-heading-feature-closure-checklist.md`.
- Purpose: prevent repeat review loops around the same IME / direct shortcut / placeholder axis after `75726f9 fix: polish empty rich heading placeholder`.
- Current classification is now explicit: functionality accepted, placeholder UX debt resolved, optional release visual check not blocking.
- Review memory in the checklist records `prior_review_count=1`, `accepted_scope=IME_and_shortcut_functional_path`, `resolved_scope=placeholder_caret_visual_debt_by_css_first_fix`, `not_accepted_scope=release_wide_visual_acceptance`, and `repeated_general_review=false`.
- This slice changed documentation only. No implementation, E2E body, AGENTS, GitHub cleanup, storage/import/export, Electron/package, dependency, DB/auth/API, or embed security behavior changed.
- Future Review Card rule: do not ask the user to re-review the same IME / shortcut / placeholder basics unless a new target, new evidence, changed axis, suspected regression, or user-requested recheck appears.

### 2026-06-22 Rich heading placeholder polish

- Local `main` was first updated from `origin/main`: `git fetch --prune origin` showed `origin/main` ahead, `git pull --ff-only origin main` fast-forwarded from `b56e925` to `05c3379`, and post-pull checks returned clean `## main...origin/main` plus `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`.
- Consumed the attached review intake for the Rich editing typed heading shortcut. The user-side Microsoft IME / direct `#` / `##` / `###` + Space behavior was treated as functionally OK; the remaining issue was a narrow UX debt where the empty heading placeholder `章タイトルを入力` could visually compete with the caret immediately after conversion.
- Implemented a CSS-first polish: empty heading placeholders are now absolutely positioned out of text flow, and the pseudo-element is not generated while `#wysiwyg-editor` has focus. The hint remains available when the empty heading is not actively being edited.
- Added focused E2E coverage in `e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js` for the active empty heading placeholder state. Existing heading shortcut behavior, Undo, negative cases, paste handling, Markdown source round-trip, and synthetic IME guard remain covered by the same focused grep.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-22/rich-heading-placeholder-polish.md`. Validation for this slice: `node --check e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js`, `git diff --check`, `npx playwright test e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line --grep "heading shortcut"` -> 11 passed, and `npm run lint:js:check`.
- Non-targets preserved: `js/editor-wysiwyg.js`, shortcut semantics, IME composition gate, storage/import/export, Electron/package behavior, dependencies, DB/auth/API contracts, GitHub cleanup, embed security, and AGENTS rules were not changed.
- Review state: required user-side work is none. A later human visual feel check is optional before release, but the submitted review debt is resolved for this slice.

### 2026-06-22 Remote sync / cross-terminal context handoff

- Local `main` was checked against `origin/main` after `git fetch --prune origin`; there were no new remote commits to pull, `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count "HEAD...origin/main"` returned `0 0`.
- Pre-handoff baseline commit before this docs-only note was `d9198b5 docs: align ime spotcheck handoff head`. This handoff records the current restart context without changing product/runtime behavior.
- This pass preserves restart context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/verification/2026-06-22/remote-sync-context-handoff.md`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-22/remote-sync-context-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Active residue is unchanged: the Rich heading shortcut is implemented and agent-verified, but native Japanese IME candidate-window behavior remains `USER_RUN_REQUIRED` via `docs/verification/2026-06-18/rich-heading-ime-spotcheck.md`. If that comes back OK, the shortcut can be treated as screen-checked; if NG, keep the next slice narrow around `js/editor-wysiwyg.js` composition gating and typed heading shortcut handling.
- Product/runtime state is unchanged by this handoff. Latest editor product proof remains WP-SAVELOAD-001 / `writing-trust-workflow-001`; the next product entry remains stale spec reconciliation unless the user selects a different one-topic slice or returns an IME NG report.

### 2026-06-18 Rich heading IME spot-check

- Local `main` was fast-forwarded to `origin/main` after `git fetch --prune origin` showed one remote commit ahead. Post-pull checks returned clean `## main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`; current `HEAD` after the IME spot-check handoff is `b56e925 docs: record rich heading ime spotcheck`.
- Added verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-18/rich-heading-ime-spotcheck.md`. This is a docs/verification-only slice; product code, E2E bodies, storage/import/export behavior, Electron/package behavior, dependencies, DB/auth/API contracts, GitHub cleanup, and AGENTS rules were not changed.
- Local app launch succeeded at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html` with HTTP 200. Agent-side browser verification passed for line-start `#` / `##` / `###` + Space conversion to H1/H2/H3, one-step Undo back to the typed marker, and synthetic `compositionstart` / `compositionend` suppression. Focused E2E also passed: `npx playwright test e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line --grep "heading shortcut"` -> 10 passed.
- Native Japanese IME operation remains `USER_RUN_REQUIRED`: Windows Japanese language/culture is present, but the available automation path cannot honestly operate the Microsoft IME candidate window. The Review Card in the verification note asks the user to check IME composition misfire, intended shortcut conversion, and immediate Undo on the local Rich editing screen.
- Continuation state: if the user replies OK, the shortcut can be treated as screen-checked except for any later release/platform pass. If the user replies NG, keep the next slice narrow around `js/editor-wysiwyg.js` composition gating and typed heading shortcut handling; do not broaden into a general Markdown shortcut or editor redesign.

### 2026-06-18 Remote sync / cross-terminal context handoff

- Local `main` was first fast-forwarded from `89548fd` to `5bd3f71` with `git pull --ff-only origin main`; the post-pull upstream comparison returned `0 0` for `git rev-list --left-right --count "HEAD...origin/main"` before this docs handoff was written.
- The only pre-existing local worktree change was the thin `AGENTS.md` footer `## Imported Claude Cowork project instructions`; it was preserved with the current remote `AGENTS.md` review/autonomy pointer and included in this handoff rather than discarded.
- This pass preserves restart context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/verification/2026-06-18/remote-sync-context-handoff.md`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-18/remote-sync-context-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; when the work touches review/autonomy or handoff behavior, also read `docs/OPERATOR_REVIEW_UX.md`, `docs/ai/STATUS_AND_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ai/WORKFLOWS_AND_PHASES.md`, and `docs/OPERATOR_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Product/runtime state is unchanged by this handoff. The latest editor product proof remains WP-SAVELOAD-001 / `writing-trust-workflow-001`; the active next product entry remains stale spec reconciliation unless the user selects a different one-topic slice.

### 2026-06-17 Remote sync handoff after v1.8 review/autonomy docs

- Local `main` was checked clean against `origin/main` after `d4de62d docs: add freeform review autonomy guidance`; `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count 'HEAD...@{u}'` returned `0 0`.
- This pass preserves the restart context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `docs/verification/2026-06-17/freeform-review-autonomy-remote-handoff.md`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-17/freeform-review-autonomy-remote-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; for review/autonomy context also read `docs/OPERATOR_REVIEW_UX.md`, `docs/ai/STATUS_AND_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ai/WORKFLOWS_AND_PHASES.md`, and `docs/OPERATOR_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Next practical entry points: use Review Card / Freeform Review Intake in the next reviewable artifact, audit remaining MkDocs warning noise, or return to product work selected from `docs/ROADMAP.md` / `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`.

### 2026-06-17 v1.8 Freeform Review / Long-Run Autonomy docs

- Maintenance slice for agent reporting and review UX. Added `docs/OPERATOR_REVIEW_UX.md` as the review/autonomy entry point and connected it from `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai/STATUS_AND_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ai/WORKFLOWS_AND_PHASES.md`, `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`, `docs/OPERATOR_WORKFLOW.md`, README surfaces, `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/index.md`, and `mkdocs.yml`.
- Review guidance now forbids fixed review phrases for user-facing artifact judgment, requires a Review Card when user review is actually needed, and treats freeform review as valid input parsed internally into target / intent / constraints / confidence.
- Operation Cockpit checkpoint reports now include Review Card / Review Debt, optional Freeform Review Intake Result, explicit User-Side Work, and Handoff Gate result. A next-agent prompt is not emitted unless the handoff gate is actually satisfied.
- Long-run autonomy is now explicit: when the next 1-3 actions are clear, reversible, and scoped, the assistant should execute them before reporting rather than merely listing them.
- `docs/RUNTIME_STATE.md` was not recreated. Current restart/runtime facts remain anchored in `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`; Operation Cockpit is a report shape, not a persistent runtime-state file.

### 2026-06-15 Local docs overview and remote handoff

- Local documentation browser context is now preserved in project files. The latest docs-view proof before this handoff is `6add8c4 docs: add project overview map`, building on `5b60db7 docs: add local mkdocs browser view`.
- Added overview entry points: `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/VISUAL_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`, and `docs/TURN_PLAN.md`. These pages point reviewers to the existing source documents; they do not replace, translate, or summarize specifications as a new authority.
- MkDocs Material remains the local-only browser view. `docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, and `tools/generate-doc-nav.ps1` include the overview pages under the Overview tree.
- Verification before the handoff: `python -m mkdocs build --clean` succeeded; the remaining warnings are existing links from source docs to excluded code/E2E/generated paths or wrapper-relative targets. The local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8005/` returned HTTP 200 for `/PROJECT_OVERVIEW/`, `/VISUAL_EVIDENCE_INDEX/`, and `/TURN_PLAN/`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-15/local-docs-overview-remote-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`. For this docs-browser context, then read `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/VISUAL_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`, `docs/TURN_PLAN.md`, and `docs/index.md`.
- Next practical entry points: generate/curate a small visual evidence set, audit `FEATURE_REGISTRY` coverage gaps, separate stale references from active next-slice instructions, or return to product work selected from `docs/ROADMAP.md` / `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`.

### 2026-06-15 WP-SAVELOAD-001 Editor Trust Vertical Slice

- Active Artifact `writing-trust-workflow-001`。Zen Writer を「原稿を預けられる Editor」として再評価し、新規文書作成、Rich editing 本文入力、Documents 明示保存、自動保存後 reload、chapterMode 親 document 対象、TXT / Markdown / JSON export、JSON import roundtrip、不正 JSON import 非破壊失敗、保存失敗表示を 1 本の workflow として確認した。
- Product fixes: `beforeunload` が chapterMode 章 0 件 document を空 assembled text で上書きしないよう修正。非同期 IDB 初期化が runtime docs cache を古い IDB docs で上書きしないよう修正。raw current id が章 ID の場合も保存・書き出し対象を親 document へ正規化。
- Save-state visibility: `#writing-status-chip` は `編集中` / `保存済み` に加え、保存失敗時に `data-save-state="failed"` と `保存失敗` を表示。Documents 明示保存も失敗時に `保存失敗` を通知する。
- Import/export proof: 新規 `e2e/editor-trust-workflow.spec.js` は TXT / Markdown / JSON の実 download file を読み取り、JSON import roundtrip と破損 JSON import の非破壊失敗を確認。既存 `export-trust` / `import-roundtrip-hardening` / `chapter-creation-daily-flow` も再実行して green。
- Unit proof: 新規 `test/storage-roundtrip.test.js` は `ZenWriterStorage.importProjectJSON()` の duplicate suffix、新規 ID、invalid JSON 非破壊、保存失敗時 import 非破壊を確認。
- Manual screen proof: Browser で `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html` を開き、status chip の `編集中` -> `保存済み HH:mm`、Documents help の「この端末に自動保存」「外部退避」、`入出力` menu の TXT / JSON / JSON読み込みを確認。
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-15/editor-trust-vertical-slice.md`。保存モデルの短い入口は `docs/EDITOR_TRUST_WORKFLOW.md`。
- Non-targets preserved: Rich Editing 新機能、Reader 表現拡張、ガジェット追加、テーマ刷新、Electron package 配布整備、Cloud sync、外部 DB / auth / API、Google Drive / Keep 連携、大規模リファクタ、GitHub Issue / PR cleanup、AGENTS.md 肥大化は未実施。

### 2026-06-08 Remote sync context handoff after ledger anchor

- Docs-only handoff for cross-terminal restart. Before editing docs, `git fetch --prune origin` completed, `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Current editor product proof remains `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut`. Latest docs reconciliation proof before this handoff is `4cb49ee docs: reconcile ledger handoff anchor`.
- This pass preserves context in project files only: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/verification/2026-06-08/remote-sync-context-handoff-after-ledger-anchor.md`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-08/remote-sync-context-handoff-after-ledger-anchor.md`.
- No product code, E2E, storage/import/export behavior, Electron/package behavior, dependencies, DB/auth/API behavior, GitHub Issue / PR cleanup, embed security audit, or AGENTS.md changes.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Next recommended entry point: a real screen/feel verification such as the Japanese IME spot-check for the Rich editing typed heading shortcut. Avoid another docs-only/readback pass unless the user explicitly asks for one.

### 2026-06-08 Ledger handoff anchor reconciliation

- Docs-only follow-through for stale spec reconciliation. Product proof remains `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut`; docs reconciliation proof before this pass is `a7b90e6 docs: reconcile heading shortcut stale specs`.
- Reconciled one active owner-doc cluster: `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` still pointed the current cross-terminal handoff at the Rich editing shortcut handoff instead of the latest docs reconciliation handoff. It now names `docs/verification/2026-06-08/stale-spec-reconciliation-after-heading-shortcut.md` and records `a7b90e6` as the docs reconciliation proof.
- Added a boundary note before dated ledger history so older next-candidate lines that mention Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision are read as historical references. The active next-slice table remains the current authority.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-08/ledger-handoff-anchor-reconciliation.md`.
- No implementation code, E2E, storage, Electron, GitHub Issue / PR cleanup, embed security audit, or AGENTS.md changes.

### 2026-06-08 Stale spec reconciliation after heading shortcut

- Docs-only reconciliation after `1982228 docs: hand off rich editing heading shortcut`. Product proof remains `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut`; no runtime code, UI contract, storage behavior, dependency, DB/auth/API, or Electron/package behavior changed.
- Current authority now treats Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision as done everywhere it is used for active slice selection. `Current Priorities` no longer lists it as the next decision, and stale spec reconciliation is the active next candidate.
- `docs/FEATURE_REGISTRY.md` now includes the typed heading shortcut as a user-facing Rich editing feature, pointing to the current handoff, implementation file, and focused E2E coverage.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` now names `FEATURE_REGISTRY` alongside `CURRENT_STATE` / `USER_REQUEST_LEDGER` for the shortcut authority. Historical verification notes that describe older next-candidate order remain historical references, not active restart instructions.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-08/stale-spec-reconciliation-after-heading-shortcut.md`.
- Validation for this docs-only slice: `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- Next candidates remain stale spec reconciliation follow-through first, optional Japanese IME spot-check before release, and GitHub cleanup only as non-blocking bookkeeping.

### 2026-06-08 Rich editing typed heading shortcut

- Product proof anchor for the current editor slice is `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut`. The previous import-trust proof `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip` remains the baseline for JSON import behavior, not the current editor shortcut proof.
- Rich editing now adopts the heading shortcut as a **limited typed trigger**: in the normal contenteditable surface, line-start `# ` / `## ` / `### ` confirmed by Space converts the current paragraph/div to H1/H2/H3. It does not add a general Markdown shortcut engine.
- Boundaries preserved: `#hashtag`, inline `# `, and `#### ` stay literal; paste, import, Markdown source round-trip, `markdownToHtml`, and `htmlToMarkdown` stay on the existing conversion paths; IME composition is gated; Undo immediately after conversion restores the typed marker.
- Sections / chapterMode boundary is unchanged. The shortcut only creates real heading blocks in the editor surface and does not replace `+ 新しい章`, ChapterStore creation, or the Markdown source escape hatch.
- Validation for the product slice: `node --check js/editor-wysiwyg.js`, `npx playwright test e2e/wysiwyg-editor.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line --grep "heading shortcut"` (10 passed), `npm run test:smoke`, `npm run lint:js:check`, and `git diff --check` all passed before the product commit.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-08/rich-editing-heading-shortcut-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Next candidates shift to stale spec reconciliation first. Optional follow-up before a release cut: manual Japanese IME spot-check for the typed shortcut. GitHub Issue / PR cleanup remains non-blocking bookkeeping and is not product progress.

### 2026-06-05 Remote sync after GitHub artifact authority correction

- Local `main` was checked after `git fetch --prune origin` and `git pull --ff-only origin main`; remote was already up to date at `c272503 docs: downgrade stale github artifacts`.
- Product proof anchor remains `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip`. This handoff changes only project docs so another terminal can resume from current `main` without chat history.
- Pre-handoff sync checks: `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-05/remote-sync-after-github-artifact-authority-correction.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Next candidates remain current-main product work: `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first, stale spec reconciliation second. GitHub Issue / PR cleanup remains non-blocking bookkeeping and is not product progress.

### 2026-06-05 GitHub artifact authority correction

- Correction to the Issue #118 / PR #119 meta-review: GitHub Issue / PR cleanup is not a human-side blocker and must not block current-main product work in this repo.
- Authority order: current `main`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, `docs/INVARIANTS.md`, implementation diffs, verification results, and explicit user-selected work outrank open GitHub Issues / PRs. Open Issue / open PR state alone is weak management information, not an active artifact.
- Keep the previous evidence: PR #119 is stale / reference-only, must not be merged / rebased / cherry-picked, and `feature/ISSUE-118-postmessage-security` must not be reused as an implementation branch. Issue #118, if revisited, is a current-main missing-DoD narrow audit only.
- Withdraw the previous blocker framing: PR #119 close / Issue #118 close is bookkeeping, not product progress and not a prerequisite for resuming current-main development. If an agent can safely do cleanup, it may; otherwise record stale / reference-only status in docs and return to the mainline.
- Human input should be requested only for product priority: whether embed security should become the next selected product slice, or whether to continue with `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` / stale spec reconciliation.

### 2026-06-05 Issue #118 / PR #119 meta-review gate

- Corrected gate result: GitHub artifacts are non-blocking stale/reference context. Do not implement Issue #118 from PR #119, and do not merge / rebase / cherry-pick PR #119. The next product move should return to current-main priorities unless the user explicitly selects embed security.
- Active artifact remains the current `main` writing-trust state. Product proof anchor remains `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip`; next product candidates remain `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first and stale spec reconciliation second.
- Git readback after `git fetch --prune origin`: local `HEAD` and `origin/main` are synchronized (`HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`), and `HEAD` is contained by `main` / `origin/main`. The working tree already had staged docs-only cross-terminal handoff changes from 2026-06-04.
- Issue #118 is still open and describes postMessage security / child-bridge strict parent+origin checks / cross-origin demos / docs / dev-check. `docs/EMBED_TESTING.md` referenced by the issue does not exist in current `main`; treat that path as stale and use `docs/EMBED_SDK.md` plus source readback instead.
- PR #119 is open from `feature/ISSUE-118-postmessage-security` to `main`, but its changed files are SP-073 PathText freehand drawing files, not embed/security files. Its head commit `4f620e9` has the same tree as current-main ancestor `49c3c2f feat: SP-073 Phase 4 フリーハンド描画...`, so that payload is already present on `main` under the correct PathText commit.
- The PR branch is stale and dangerous as a merge source: `origin/main..origin/feature/ISSUE-118-postmessage-security` shows a broad reverse diff that would delete current authority docs, modern E2E, Local Gadget Mod work, writing-trust proofs, and other current surfaces.
- Current `main` already contains strict `child-bridge.js` parent-source/origin checks, `allowedOrigin` target sends, SDK targetOrigin handling, cross-origin demo, and `scripts/dev-check.js` security pattern checks. Treat Issue #118 as a close / audit candidate, not as approval to start a new branch automatically.
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-05/issue-118-pr-119-meta-review.md`.

### 2026-06-04 Remote sync and cross-terminal handoff

- Local `main` was fast-forwarded from `4aa2f62 docs: record restart roadmap handoff` to `d007bf0 docs: hand off current sync context` after `git fetch origin` showed new remote work. The pulled remote work includes Import Roundtrip Hardening and the 2026-06-03 current-context handoff.
- Product proof anchor remains `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip`; this 2026-06-04 handoff changes only project docs so another terminal can restart without chat history.
- Before this docs update, `git status --short --branch` showed clean `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Current handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-04/remote-sync-cross-terminal-handoff.md`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.
- Next candidates remain unchanged after the pull: `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first, `Docs Hygiene: stale spec reconciliation` second. WP-004 parity pack remains a user-actor release gate only when a fresh preview / Reader difference appears.

### 2026-06-03 Remote sync and current-context handoff

- Product proof anchor は引き続き `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip`。今回の handoff は product code / UI 契約 / storage 契約 / dependency / DB / auth / API behavior を変えず、再開文脈を project docs に固定する docs-only slice。
- Pre-handoff context anchor: `b9948fb docs: hand off import roundtrip sync`。`git fetch --prune origin` 後、docs 編集前の `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` は `0 0`、`git status --short --branch` は clean `## main...origin/main`。docs validation は `git diff --cached --check` と `npm run test:smoke` が PASS。
- Remote handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-06-03/remote-sync-current-context-handoff.md`。
- 別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後、clean `main...origin/main` と `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0` を確認し、`docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md` を読む。次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。
- 次候補は変えない。`Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` が第一候補、`Docs Hygiene: stale spec reconciliation` が第二候補。WP-004 parity pack は新しい preview / Reader 差分が出た時の user-actor release gate として残す。

### 2026-05-25 Remote sync handoff after Import Roundtrip Hardening

- Product proof anchor: `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip`。Import Roundtrip Hardening は `origin/main` へ push 済み。
- Remote handoff anchor: `docs/verification/2026-05-25/remote-sync-import-roundtrip-handoff.md`。
- 同期確認: handoff note 作成前の `git status --short --branch` は `## main...origin/main`、`git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` は `0 0`。
- 再開手順: 別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後、clean `main...origin/main` と `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0` を確認し、`docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md` を読む。次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。
- 次候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` が第一候補、`Docs Hygiene: stale spec reconciliation` が第二候補。WP-004 parity pack は新しい preview / Reader 差分が出た時の user-actor release gate として残す。

### 2026-05-25 Import Roundtrip Hardening

- JSON 読み込みは `ZenWriterStorage.importProjectJSON(jsonString)` の公開形を変えず、保存前に parse / format / pages 正規化を済ませる。失敗時は既存 docs を変更せず `null` を返す。
- 明示 `format` は従来どおり `zenwriter-` 系だけ許可。`format` なし legacy pages-only JSON は、有効な page がある時だけ `読み込みドキュメント` として戻せる。
- import は常に新規 document / chapter ID を作る。同名 document は `元タイトル (読み込み 2)` から決定的に suffix を付け、章タイトルの重複は創作上の意図として保持する。
- pages は `order` 昇順、同値は元配列順で並べ、保存時 order を `0..n-1` に正規化。level / visibility / blank title / non-string content を安全側へ丸め、document.content が空なら pages から Markdown 本文を再構成する。
- Verification anchor: `docs/verification/2026-05-25/import-roundtrip-hardening.md`。新規 E2E は `e2e/import-roundtrip-hardening.spec.js`。
- 次候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` を第一候補、stale spec reconciliation を第二候補に移す。WP-004 parity pack は新しい preview / Reader 差分が出た時の user-actor release gate のまま。

### 2026-05-15 Remote sync and restart roadmap handoff

- Current docs handoff is recorded in `docs/verification/2026-05-15/remote-sync-restart-roadmap-handoff.md`.
- Before this docs update, local `main` was clean and synchronized with `origin/main`: `git status --short --branch` showed `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Product proof remains `8770edd feat: clarify first-use save help`; this handoff preserves restart context and roadmap analysis only.
- Local readiness checked in this block: `npm run test:smoke`, `npm run lint:js:check`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed. `npx playwright test --list` reported 66 spec files and 588 tests.
- Not run in this block: full monolithic E2E and Electron package build. Continue to prefer focused Playwright specs / shards or targeted Electron checks when a slice touches those surfaces.
- Next-slice priority remains: `Import Roundtrip Hardening` first, `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` second, stale spec reconciliation third. WP-004 parity pack remains a user-actor release gate unless a new preview / Reader difference appears.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main` and `HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`; use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-05-14 Remote sync handoff after First-use Save Help

- Remote handoff after First-use Save Help is recorded in `docs/verification/2026-05-14/remote-sync-first-use-save-help-handoff.md`.
- Product proof before handoff: `8770edd feat: clarify first-use save help`.
- Local `main` was pulled with `git pull --ff-only origin main`; it was already up to date with `origin/main`.
- Pre-handoff sync check: `git status --short --branch` showed `## main...origin/main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` returned `0 0`.
- Restart from another terminal: run `git pull --ff-only origin main`, confirm clean `main...origin/main`, then read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`. Use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when choosing the next slice.

### 2026-05-14 First-use Save Help restart anchor

- First-use Save Help is now the latest writing-trust slice. It does not add a new save model; it makes the existing local autosave / Documents / TXT/JSON takeout model readable to first-time or returning users.
- Product help: `#writing-status-chip` now exposes an aria/title explanation that body text is auto-saved on this device and the chip shows save state. Documents shows a short helper line for local autosave, status location, TXT/JSON external takeout, JSON import, and chapter structure. The empty Documents state points `+ 文書` users toward local autosave. The `入出力` menu adds a short external-takeout hint and clearer item titles for TXT export, JSON export, and JSON import.
- E2E anchor: `e2e/first-use-save-help.spec.js` covers first-use empty Documents, document creation, Rich editing body entry, saved status chip, Documents discovery, import/export wording, no `JSON保存` regression, and a chapter-mode document retaining two chapter records while the same help remains visible.
- Not included: Cloud sync, EPUB/DOCX, floating memo persistence, top chrome/toolbar revival, export UI redesign, chapter template/outline features, or broad stale-doc cleanup.

### 2026-05-13 Chapter Creation Daily Flow restart anchor

- Chapter Creation Daily Flow is now the latest writing-trust proof. The verified user path is: new document -> Rich editing -> `+ 新しい章` -> two chapter titles/bodies -> chapter switching -> save/reload resume -> Reader round trip -> TXT/JSON export -> JSON import roundtrip.
- Product fix: chapterMode `+ 新しい章` now stays on the `ZWChapterStore.createChapter()` route even when the document has zero existing chapter records. Existing editor text is split into the first chapter before appending a new chapter, so adding a chapter no longer risks turning the current body into an unstructured heading insert.
- Product fix: chapter slice editing in the normal Rich editing surface now flushes to the chapter store, and TXT/Markdown export uses `ZWChapterStore.assembleFullText()` when chapter pages exist. This keeps TXT export from accidentally exporting only the active chapter slice.
- E2E anchor: `e2e/chapter-creation-daily-flow.spec.js` covers chapter creation, body isolation, save/reload, Reader, TXT/JSON export, and JSON import roundtrip. `e2e/sections-nav.spec.js` daily writing expectations were updated to match the chapterMode Store route.
- Not included: Cloud sync, EPUB/DOCX, floating memo persistence, top chrome/toolbar revival, chapter templates, outline editor, drag/drop chapter reorder, and broad stale-doc cleanup.

## Latest Handoff

- New: Remote sync after Markdown source authority reconciliation を docs-only で追加。`git fetch origin` 後の `main...origin/main` は clean、`HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`、最新反映済み文脈は `8db12aa docs: reconcile markdown source authority`。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `CURRENT_STATE` -> `INVARIANTS` -> `INTERACTION_NOTES` を読み、次スライス選定時だけ `USER_REQUEST_LEDGER` / `ROADMAP` を読む。Runtime / E2E body / storage / Electron / AGENTS は未変更。
- New: Active authority Markdown source dev gate reconciliation を docs-only で実施。通常導線は Rich editing / MD プレビュー / Reader として読み、Markdown source は開発者モードの escape hatch としてだけ扱うよう `INTERACTION_NOTES`、`UI_SURFACE_AND_CONTROLS`、`GADGETS`、`USER_REQUEST_LEDGER`、`ROADMAP` を最小更新した。Runtime / E2E body / command palette implementation / storage / Electron / AGENTS は未変更。歴史ログと superseded specs は active authority ではないため書き換えていない。
- New: Command palette Markdown source dev gate を実施。`editor-surface-markdown` は開発者モード限定の command になり、通常配布相当の command palette では `Markdown ソース` 検索に出ない。開発者モードでは escape hatch として残り、説明文も開発者モード境界を明示する。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md` を読み、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。WP-005、Project import recovery、Rich heading、Rich text block align は新規 failure なしに reopen しない。
- New: Remote sync context handoff を docs-only で追加。`git fetch --prune origin` 後の `main...origin/main` は clean、`HEAD...origin/main = 0 0`。最新 editor product proof は `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut`、最新 docs reconciliation proof は `4cb49ee docs: reconcile ledger handoff anchor`。次端末は `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md` を読み、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。Product code / E2E / storage / Electron / GitHub cleanup / embed security / AGENTS.md は未変更。次は docs-only 連続ではなく、Rich editing typed heading shortcut の日本語 IME spot-check など実画面確認を優先候補に戻す。
- New: `USER_REQUEST_LEDGER` の current handoff anchor を docs reconciliation proof まで進め、dated history が current next-candidate order と誤読されないように境界文を追加した。Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision は引き続き Done、stale spec reconciliation follow-through が第一候補。Product code / E2E / storage / Electron / GitHub cleanup / embed security / AGENTS.md は未変更。
- New: stale spec reconciliation after heading shortcut を docs-only で実施。Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision は完了済みとして `Current Priorities` を更新し、typed heading shortcut を `FEATURE_REGISTRY` に登録した。`ROADMAP` の authority 説明も `FEATURE_REGISTRY` を含む形へ寄せた。Product proof は `1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut` のまま。次候補は stale spec reconciliation follow-through first、任意の日本語 IME spot-check は release 前確認、GitHub Issue / PR cleanup は non-blocking bookkeeping。
- New: Rich editing typed heading shortcut を限定採用として実装。`1e33e38 feat: add rich editing heading shortcut` が product proof。Rich editing 通常入力の行頭 `# ` / `## ` / `### ` だけを H1/H2/H3 へ変換し、`#hashtag`、行中 `# `、`#### `、paste、import、Markdown source round-trip、`markdownToHtml` / `htmlToMarkdown` は既存挙動に残す。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。次候補は stale spec reconciliation first、任意の手動 IME spot-check は release 前確認として扱う。
- New: Remote sync after GitHub artifact authority correction を追加。`main` / `origin/main` は `c272503 docs: downgrade stale github artifacts` で同期済み。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。その時点の次候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first、stale spec reconciliation second。
- New: GitHub artifact authority correction を追加。PR #119 は Issue #118 の実装 PR として信用せず、SP-073 PathText freehand drawing の重複 artifact / stale branch として reference-only に下げる判断は維持する。一方で、PR #119 / Issue #118 の GitHub close は人間側 blocker ではなく帳簿整理に降格する。Issue #118 を扱う必要が出た場合だけ current `main` から missing DoD の narrow audit とし、その時点の通常候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` / stale spec reconciliation だった。
- New: 2026-06-04 Remote sync and cross-terminal handoff を追加。local `main` は `d007bf0 docs: hand off current sync context` まで fast-forward 済みで、product proof は `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip` のまま。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。その時点の次候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first、stale spec reconciliation second。
- New: Remote sync and current-context handoff を追加。product proof は `a56671b test: harden import roundtrip` のまま、pre-handoff context は `b9948fb docs: hand off import roundtrip sync`。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。その時点の次候補は `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision` first、stale spec reconciliation second。
- New: Remote sync handoff after Import Roundtrip Hardening を追加。`a56671b test: harden import roundtrip` を product proof anchor とし、別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。
- New: Import Roundtrip Hardening を実施。`importProjectJSON` は保存前正規化に移し、不正 JSON / unsupported format / empty JSON / invalid legacy pages-only は docs を変更せず `null`。format-less pages-only は有効 page がある時だけ受け入れ、同名 document は `読み込み N` suffix、新規章 ID、正規化 order / level / visibility / blank title / content fallback で復元する。Export schema、Documents UI 文言、Electron menu、Cloud sync / EPUB / DOCX / Rich editing shortcut / Floating memo 保存モデルは未変更。

- Shared focus: session 127〜129 の unified shell foundation、daily writing narrow fix、writing workflow friction sweep を、現行判断の起点にする。
- Trusted: Story Wiki / Link Graph / Compare の shell token 寄せ、gadget collapse 契約、left nav label/icon/panel/gadget 対応、package safe launcher。
- Closed: visible top chrome surface は廃止。旧 `ZenWriterTopChrome` / `menu:toggle-toolbar` 互換経路は command palette へ誘導し、F2 / Electron menu も command palette を開く。
- New: Editor surface は「Editor = 唯一の執筆面」「Rich editing = 既定のリッチ編集表示」「Markdown source = 開発者向け escape hatch」「Reader = 編集不可の読者確認 surface」で整理済み。Documents は作成・保存・入出力・管理を分け、`JSON保存` ではなく `JSON書き出し` と呼ぶ。周辺 gadget も `+ Wikiページ`、`+ 構成プリセット`、`TXT書き出し`、`プロファイル保存`、`ロードアウト適用` のように対象つき label へ寄せる。
- New: `#writing-status-chip` は Reader / Floating memo lab 非表示時だけ文字数と `編集中` / `保存済み` を非操作型で表示する。`GadgetPrefs` も `LoadoutManager` と同じ hide-by-default に移した。
- New: `main-hub-panel` の active source refs は削除済み。legacy command compatibility (`toggle-fullscreen` / `ui-mode-*`) は hidden 互換として維持する。
- New: Electron window drag はユーザー確認で安定。今後の主軸は 2 レーンに分ける。Lane A は無重力メモ / Floating memo lab の visual iteration と productization gate、Lane B はガジェット再整理の usefulness audit と default loadout cleanup。どちらも現行 Editor / Reader / left nav 契約を壊さず、実装スライスは 1 トピックに限定する。
- New: Gadget cleanup は削除ではなく標準導線から下げる方針。`UISettings` は日常表示・文字サイズ・placeholder・自動保存だけ、`EditorAdvancedSettings` はリッチ編集改行 / Textbox / 浮遊パネル / gadget 表示を持つ。`MarkdownPreview` は標準 preset から外し、`FontDecoration` / `TextAnimation` は `TextEffects` へ統合して VN preset だけ残す。
- New: Phase 1 既知 regression は解消済み。left nav category の root 戻りは sidebar 左列の空白クリックだけで発火し、button / input / link / tree item / gadget controls は奪わない。Story Wiki full mode は containing gadget の collapsed/hidden 状態を解除し、full pane を viewport 幅で表示して backlinks detail を見せる。
- New: B3 初回候補として `FontDecoration` / `TextAnimation` を `TextEffects` へ統合。旧 loadout 名は normalization で `TextEffects` へ移行し、custom loadout の明示利用は保つ。テキストアニメーション gadget 経路は `applyTextAnimation` を呼ぶ。
- New: Writing UX map の優先順位は **Editor canvas > 保存/文字数 status > Documents/Sections > on-demand Gadgets > experimental memo**。Floating memo は本流保存・正式 Gadget・loadout へ接続せず、執筆面の外縁に出る experimental fragment として扱う。次の設計候補は「保存安心感」または「Gadget 情報設計」だが、実装は別スライスに分ける。
- New: A1 Floating memo reframe は完了。背景 memo は visible title / state / `DRAG` / textarea 枠を持たず、短い read-only fragment として漂う。foreground だけ borderless textarea を表示し、既定サンプルで明示 scrollbar を出さない。既存の memo identity / despawn-respawn / touch slop / focus restore / reduced-motion 契約は維持する。
- New: Build output の正本は `dist/`（`npm run build` / `app:open:dist`）と `build/`（Electron builder / `build/win-unpacked/Zen Writer.exe`）だけ。旧 `build-new/` / `build-session*/` / `build-friction/` はロック回避の一時退避物で、`npm run clean:builds` で削除する。
- New: A2 daily writing proof は E2E 化済み。Rich editing で短い原稿を入れ、Sections 表示、`#writing-status-chip` の `編集中`→`保存済み`、Reader 往復、Floating memo lab 開閉後の editor focus 復帰を 1 本の flow で確認する。保存モデルや正式 Gadget 化は A3 まで保留。
- New: Closeout 整理では `.serena/project.yml` のテンプレ差分を tool noise として HEAD へ戻し、`.playwright-mcp/` と root の確認用 PNG を ignore。`scripts/clean-build-outputs.js` は `package.json` から参照される正式差分として残す。
- New: A3 productization gate は **command palette 限定の実験導線** で確定。`浮遊メモ実験` は保存されない隔離実験 overlay を開閉する正規入口で、`?memoLab=1` は E2E / developer 用の直接起動 hook としてのみ残す。保存モデル、設定、正式 Gadget 化、loadout preset、Documents / Sections / autosave 接続は追加しない。
- New: 2026-05-08 restart consolidation で、A3 closeout は未コミット差分ではなく `db3b3df` として remote 反映済みであることを確認。`.serena/project.yml` の Serena template churn は tool noise として HEAD へ戻し、次スライスは C2 Gadget information design の read-only audit から 1 トピックに絞る。B3 merge / delete は audit で候補が出るまで始めない。
- New: Local Gadget Mod MVP を追加。`PluginManager` は設定モーダル内の `ローカルMod` として manifest 上の Mod を表示し、enable/disable を `zw_plugin_manager_enabled` に保存する。`api.gadgets.register()` 経由の gadget は `source: 'plugin'` と `pluginId` を持ち、enabled Mod は loadout に明示列挙されていなくても指定 group へ表示される。反映は reload 後でよい。
- New: Local Gadget Mod 開発ワークフローを整理。`docs/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md` は候補判定→folder entry→manifest→`window.ZWPlugin.register()`→`ローカルMod` enable→reload→検証の正本、`docs/specs/spec-local-gadget-mods.md` は判断ゲート、`docs/GADGETS.md` は built-in 例外ルート、`docs/design/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md` は背景設計 / deferred を担当する。
- New: C2 Gadget Mod boundary audit を実施。`MarkdownPreview` は標準 preset から除外済みで developer/audit 用入口に近いため、最初の Local Gadget Mod migration 候補に固定。StoryWiki / LinkGraph / Images は preserve / contextual、LoadoutManager / GadgetPrefs は admin hide 維持。
- New: B3 follow-up として `MarkdownPreview` の built-in gadget wrapper を `markdown-preview-gadget` Local Mod へ移動。manifest 既定は disabled、設定モーダル `ローカルMod` で enable し reload 後に edit group へ出る。preview pipeline 本体と既存 preview 導線は変更しない。
- New: 次の高優先候補として `HUDSettings` の built-in gadget wrapper を `hud-settings-gadget` Local Mod へ移動。manifest 既定は disabled、設定モーダル `ローカルMod` で enable し reload 後に advanced group へ出る。HUD 本体 / `ZenWriterHUD` / autosave HUD / command palette HUD 表示は変更しない。
- New: `PomodoroTimer` Mod feasibility audit を実施。wrapper は `js/gadgets-pomodoro.js`、engine は `js/pomodoro-timer.js`、標準 assist preset と `e2e/pomodoro.spec.js` は built-in visible 前提。さらに settings UI が `ZWGadgets.registerSettings('PomodoroTimer', ...)` を使う一方、現行 Plugin API は `api.gadgets.registerSettings()` を公開していないため、次判断は API 追加込みの完全 Mod 化か built-in retain の 2 択に絞る。
- New: ユーザー判断により `PomodoroTimer` は小説執筆自体には不要な補助と確定。`api.gadgets.registerSettings()` を追加し、timer UI と settings UI を `pomodoro-timer-gadget` Local Mod へ移動。manifest 既定は disabled、enable + reload 後だけ assist group に表示される。`window.ZenWriterPomodoro`、Pomodoro storage、HUD notification は built-in のまま維持する。
- New: Local Gadget Mod migration lane を closeout。`MarkdownPreview` / `HUDSettings` / `PomodoroTimer` の 3 件は externalized set として固定し、`choice` は command plugin 維持、StoryWiki / LinkGraph / Images は preserve / contextual、LoadoutManager / GadgetPrefs は admin hide 維持。追加 migration は standing next action にしない。
- New: active help / shortcut resources に残っていた旧 `Normal / Focus / 表示モード切替` 語彙を cleanup。`docs/EDITOR_HELP.md`、in-app help、MarkdownReference shortcuts は `F2 = command palette` と command palette / left nav / Reader surface モデルへ同期済み。
- New: Docs authority hygiene after active help cleanup を実施。`ROADMAP` の直近 done と `FEATURE_REGISTRY` FR-009 を現行ヘルプ / shortcut / Local Mod 境界へ同期し、旧 Focus panel 由来の設定導線、旧ガジェット件数表記、古い help authority 日付を現行正本から外した。
- New: Writing status visibility follow-up として `#writing-status-chip` に最終保存時刻を追加。保存済み時は `文字数: N · 保存済み HH:mm` を表示し、`data-last-saved-at` / `ZWWritingStatusChip.getState().lastSavedAt` で保存時刻を確認できる。非操作型・Reader / Floating memo lab 非表示契約は維持する。
- New: `docs/EDITOR_HELP.md` の stale settings route cleanup を実施。設定入口は `Ctrl+,` と command palette `open-settings`、操作場所は left nav の「詳細設定」カテゴリとして説明し、旧 Focus panel 由来の設定導線と旧 three-route framing を削除した。
- New: `docs/VISUAL_PROFILE.md` の stale UI-state wording cleanup を実施。Visual Profile は公開 UI 状態切替ではなく、テーマ・背景・フォント・余白・本文表示・作業シーンの一括適用として再同期。`profile.uiMode` は legacy/internal compatibility field として残し、runtime API / profile schema / UI / storage は未変更。
- New: Remote sync handoff を実施。`main` / `origin/main` は同期済み、ローカル作業ツリーは clean。別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後、`docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。
- New: Save / Resume Trust Audit を実施。起動、新規文書、Rich editing 入力、`#writing-status-chip` の `編集中`→`保存済み HH:mm`、Documents での現在文書発見、TXT / JSON 書き出し、閉じて再起動後の同一文書・本文復帰、Reader 往復後の本文と editor focus 復帰を確認。修正は Sections 空状態の実導線案内と Documents menu 一意化に限定し、Floating memo 保存モデル化、top chrome / toolbar 復活、Cloud sync、EPUB / DOCX、Gadget 追加には進んでいない。
- New: Export Trust Proof を実施。TXT download は `ZenWriterEditor.getEditorValue()` の canonical な現在文書状態と一致することを実ファイル読取で確認。JSON download は `zenwriter-v1`、`document.id`、`document.name`、`document.content`、`pages` を JSON.parse で確認し、JSON 読み込み UI roundtrip と explicit chapter `pages` roundtrip も確認。Reader 往復後の TXT / JSON 再書き出しも同内容を保持する。
- New: Remote sync handoff after Chapter Creation Daily Flow を実施。`a024340` 時点の product proof を restart anchor とし、別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。次候補は `First-use Save Help`、`Import Roundtrip Hardening`、`Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision`、stale spec reconciliation。
- New: First-use Save Help を実施。初回空状態 / Documents / writing status chip / 入出力 menu の短い補助だけで、本文と章構造はこの端末に自動保存され、保存状態は画面下、TXT/JSON 書き出しは外部退避、JSON 読み込みは戻す導線と読めるようにした。`JSON保存` は復活させず、Cloud sync / EPUB / DOCX / top chrome / export UI redesign へは進んでいない。
- New: Remote sync handoff after First-use Save Help を実施。`8770edd` 時点の product proof を restart anchor とし、別端末では `git pull --ff-only origin main` 後に `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`、次スライス選定時だけ `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` を読む。次候補は `Import Roundtrip Hardening`、`Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision`、stale spec reconciliation。
- Do not reopen: 旧 mode button 群、常用 top toolbar、上端 hover reveal、legacy handoff/runtime/health 文書。

## Verification Results

### Command palette Markdown source dev gate

- Scope: Editor surface / command palette clarity. Markdown source remains an escape hatch for developer mode, but no longer appears as a normal command palette result for writers who cannot use it.
- Product behavior: `editor-surface-markdown` now uses the existing `devOnly` command gate and describes itself as a developer-mode source switch. `editor-surface-wysiwyg` remains the public Rich editing surface command.
- E2E proof: `e2e/command-palette.spec.js` verifies `Markdown ソース` search yields no Markdown source command when the developer-mode check is false, then verifies the command appears again when developer mode is true.
- Validation: `node --check js/command-palette.js`, `node --check e2e/command-palette.spec.js`, `npx playwright test e2e/command-palette.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line --grep "Markdown source command"`.

### First-use Save Help

- Scope: 機能追加ではなく、初回または久しぶりのユーザーが保存モデルを短時間で理解できる補助文・aria・title を追加。
- Product help: status chip は `文字数: N · 編集中/保存済み` を保ちつつ aria/title で「本文はこの端末に自動保存」「保存状態はこの表示で確認」を補助。Documents は「本文と章構造はこの端末に自動保存」「保存状態は画面下」「TXT/JSON書き出しは外部退避」「JSON読み込みで戻せる」を 1 つの短文に集約。空状態は `+ 文書` から始めると自動保存されることを示す。
- Import/export wording: `入出力` menu は「書き出しは外部退避。JSON読み込みで戻せます。」を表示し、TXT / JSON export の title も外部退避として明記。`JSON保存` は使わない。
- E2E proof: `e2e/first-use-save-help.spec.js` で first-use empty state、document creation、Rich editing body、saved chip aria、Documents discovery、import/export wording、chapter-mode 2 章保持を確認。
- Validation: `node --check js/writing-status-chip.js`, `node --check js/gadgets-documents-hierarchy.js`, `node --check js/gadgets-documents-tree.js`, `node --check e2e/first-use-save-help.spec.js`, `npx playwright test e2e/first-use-save-help.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/export-trust.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/daily-writing-proof.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/chapter-creation-daily-flow.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/content-guard.spec.js -g "Documents toolbar separates|Documents menus stay unique" --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npm run test:smoke`, `npm run lint:js:check`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit`, `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`。
- Full E2E note: monolithic full E2E remains avoided because of known timeout history; use focused specs or shard/suite runs for total inspection.

### Remote sync handoff after First-use Save Help

- Product proof: `8770edd feat: clarify first-use save help`.
- Handoff docs: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/verification/2026-05-14/remote-sync-first-use-save-help-handoff.md`.
- Pre-handoff sync: `git pull --ff-only origin main` -> already up to date; `git status --short --branch` -> `## main...origin/main`; `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` -> `0 0`.
- Restart route: `git pull --ff-only origin main` -> `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` -> `docs/INVARIANTS.md` -> `docs/INTERACTION_NOTES.md`. Use `docs/USER_REQUEST_LEDGER.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` only for next-slice selection.
- Next candidates: `Import Roundtrip Hardening`, `Rich Editing Heading Shortcut Decision`, stale spec reconciliation. First-use Save Help itself should not reopen unless a new failure appears.

### Chapter Creation Daily Flow

- Scope: prove the everyday long-form route, not just the presence of a chapter button. The covered path is `+ 新しい章` from Rich editing, chapter title/body separation, chapter switching, save/reload resume, Reader round trip, TXT/JSON export, and JSON import roundtrip.
- Chapter proof: `+ 新しい章` creates ChapterStore records from the public Sections route. Two chapters keep isolated bodies with Japanese text, symbols, blank lines, and unique tokens; switching through Sections restores the correct body and focus.
- Persistence proof: after explicit save and page reload, the same document name, two chapter records, chapter order, titles, and canonical Rich editing bodies are restored.
- Reader/export proof: Reader shows both chapter titles/bodies in order and returns focus to the editor. TXT export contains both chapter titles/bodies in order. JSON export parses as `zenwriter-v1`, keeps `document.name/content`, and has two `pages` entries with title/content/order/level/visibility. UI JSON import restores the two-chapter structure.
- Validation: `node --check js/chapter-list.js`, `node --check js/gadgets-sections-nav.js`, `node --check js/content-guard.js`, `node --check js/gadgets-documents-hierarchy.js`, `node --check js/modules/editor/EditorCore.js`, `node --check e2e/chapter-creation-daily-flow.spec.js`, `node --check e2e/sections-nav.spec.js`, `npx playwright test e2e/chapter-creation-daily-flow.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/sections-nav.spec.js -g "daily writing" --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/export-trust.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/content-guard.spec.js -g "Documents toolbar separates|Documents menus stay unique" --workers=1 --reporter=line`.
- Full E2E note: monolithic full E2E remains avoided because of known timeout history; use focused specs or shard/suite runs for total inspection.

### Export Trust Proof

- Scope: Save / Resume Trust Audit の延長として、TXT / JSON download event だけでなく、実ファイル内容を読み取って現在文書状態との一致を確認。
- TXT proof: daily Rich editing 原稿の download file を `fs.readFile` し、`ZenWriterEditor.getEditorValue()` の canonical 値と一致すること、日本語・記号・改行を含む一意文字列が欠落しないことを確認。
- JSON proof: `.zwp.json` を `JSON.parse` し、`format: zenwriter-v1`、`document.id`、`document.name`、`document.content`、`pages` を確認。章あり文書では `pages[0..]` の title / content / order / level / visibility と、assembled `document.content` を確認。
- Import / Reader proof: JSON 読み込み UI で daily 原稿が復帰。explicit chapter JSON は `importProjectJSON` で 2 章が復元。Reader 往復後の TXT / JSON 再書き出しも current editor value と一致。
- Validation: `node --check js/storage.js`, `node --check e2e/export-trust.spec.js`, `npx playwright test e2e/export-trust.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/content-guard.spec.js -g "Documents toolbar separates|Documents menus stay unique" --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npx playwright test e2e/daily-writing-proof.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=line`, `npm run test:smoke`, `git diff --check`, in-app browser launch at `http://127.0.0.1:18080/index.html`。

### Save / Resume Trust Audit

- Remote prep: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git pull --ff-only origin main`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` = `0 0` から開始。
- Observed flow: 起動 → `+ 文書` → Rich editing 入力 → `文字数: 146 · 編集中` → `文字数: 146 · 保存済み 05:09` → Documents で文書発見 → TXT / JSON 書き出し → page close/reopen → same `docId` / `Save Resume Audit 2026-05-13` / 本文復帰 → Reader 往復後 `#wysiwyg-editor` focus 復帰。
- Fixed: Sections 空状態は、Rich editing では `+ 新しい章`、Markdown ソース / 読み込み原稿では `# 見出し` が表示対象になることを明示。Documents の `入出力` / `管理` menu は category 往復後も 1 セットだけ残る。

## Known Notes

- `docs/spec-index.json` の `status: removed` は、参照先ファイルが存在しないことがある。現行仕様の探索は `done` / `partial` を優先する。
- `docs/spec-index.json` の `status: done` は「現行判断の入口」と同義ではない。summary の current pointer と各 doc 冒頭の Status を確認する。
- 旧 planning / checklist / workflow-profile stub は削除済み。再開・次作業・受け入れ確認の正本として復活させない。復元が必要な場合もファイル単位ではなく、現行の該当 specs / invariants / CURRENT_STATE へ最小事実だけ移す。
- セッション変更ログや古い検証ログは履歴参照に限る。現在判断へ持ち込まない。
- 仕様変更・方向転換・暗黙決定は、同一ブロックで役割に合う正本文書へ同期する。
- 2026-04-27 friction sweep では通常 `npm run electron:build` が既存 `build/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar` の Windows 側 file lock で失敗したため、同じソースを `build-friction/win-unpacked/` へ packaged 出力して実機確認した。次回通常 build が必要なら stale packaged process / lock を先に解放する。
