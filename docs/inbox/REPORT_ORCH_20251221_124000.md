# Report: Orchestrator Report

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-21T12:40:00+09:00
**Actor**: Cascade
**Issue/PR**: None
**Mode**: Orchestrator
**Type**: Task Division Complete

State:
- Completed Phase 0 to Phase 5 of the Orchestrator protocol.
- Updated shared-workflows submodule to commit 0bc8aad.
- Integrated reports into HANDOVER.md.
- Identified one active task (TASK_002) which is currently BLOCKED.
- Goal completion rate: 50% (setup complete, but TASK_002 remains).

Strategy:
- Workers: 1 (for TASK_002)
- Reason: TASK_002 is a single task that requires focused attention.
- Risk: The task is BLOCKED due to missing reports and documentation inconsistencies.
- Duration: 1-2 hours

Tickets:
- `@c:\Users\thank\Storage\Media Contents Projects\WritingPage\docs\tasks\TASK_002_docs_gadgets_status_cleanup.md`
  Tier 1: Clean up gadget documentation status (separate current implementation from proposals)

Next:
1. Apply the worker prompt to start resolving TASK_002.
2. Investigate the root cause of the missing reports.
3. Ensure documentation consistency.

Proposals:
1. Automate the audit process to prevent missing reports in the future.
2. Introduce a version control system for documentation.

Outlook:
- Short-term: Resolve TASK_002 and ensure documentation consistency.
- Mid-term: Implement audit automation and UI improvements.
- Long-term: Strengthen the project metadata management infrastructure.
