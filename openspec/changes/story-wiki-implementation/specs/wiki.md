# Story Wiki Implementation

## Overview
Implement a story wiki feature with AI-assisted content generation to help users build and manage story elements like characters, plots, and world-building.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Story Wiki Gadget
The application shall include a Story Wiki gadget that allows users to create and manage wiki pages for story elements.

#### Scenario: Creating a character wiki page
Given the Story Wiki gadget is open
When user creates a new page for "Protagonist"
Then a wiki page is created with sections for traits, backstory, relationships
And AI can assist in generating initial content

#### Scenario: AI-assisted plot generation
Given a plot wiki page exists
When user requests AI generation for plot points
Then AI generates plot suggestions based on existing story elements
And suggestions are integrated into the wiki

#### Scenario: Linking wiki pages
Given multiple wiki pages exist
When user creates links between pages (e.g., character to location)
Then links are navigable and maintain story consistency

## ADDED Requirements

### AI Integration for Wiki
The wiki shall integrate with AI services to assist content creation.

#### Scenario: Generating character descriptions
Given a character wiki page
When user provides basic traits
Then AI generates detailed descriptions and backstories

#### Scenario: Plot development assistance

When user requests expansion
Then AI suggests plot twists and developments

## Constraints
