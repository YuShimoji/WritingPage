# Text Animation System

## Overview
Add text animation capabilities to create dynamic reading experiences, particularly useful for graphic novel-style storytelling and interactive narratives.

## ADDED Requirements

### Fade Animation Effects
The editor shall support fade-in animations for text appearance.

#### Scenario: Fade-in text
Given text with [fade]appearing text[/fade] tags
When text is rendered in overlay or preview
Then text gradually fades in over 1.5 seconds
And timing is configurable through settings

#### Scenario: Fade-out text
Given [fadeout]disappearing text[/fadeout] tags
When rendered
Then text fades out smoothly
And can be combined with other effects

### Slide Animation Effects
The editor shall support slide-in animations for dramatic text entry.

#### Scenario: Slide from left
Given [slide]sliding text[/slide] tags
When rendered
Then text slides in from the left over 1 second
And easing provides smooth motion

#### Scenario: Custom slide direction
Given [slide:right]text[/slide] tags
When rendered
Then text slides from specified direction
And supports left, right, up, down directions

### Emphasis Animation Effects
The editor shall support attention-grabbing animation effects.

#### Scenario: Pulse effect
Given [pulse]important text[/pulse] tags
When rendered
Then text pulses with scale animation
And draws reader attention without distraction

#### Scenario: Glow effect
Given [glow]highlighted text[/glow] tags
When rendered
Then text emits soft glow effect
And creates emphasis through light

### Typewriter Animation
The editor shall support typewriter-style text revelation.

#### Scenario: Typewriter effect

When rendered
Then text appears character by character
And includes blinking cursor animation

#### Scenario: Custom typing speed
Given [typewriter:fast]quick text[/typewriter] tags
When rendered
Then typing speed adjusts based on parameter
And supports slow, normal, fast speeds

## Implementation Details

### Animation Engine
- CSS animations for performance
- JavaScript coordination for complex sequences
- Theme integration for consistent timing

### Accessibility Considerations
- Respect user motion preferences
- Provide animation toggle controls
- Ensure content remains readable without animations

### Performance Optimization
- Hardware acceleration for smooth animations
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Memory management for long documents
