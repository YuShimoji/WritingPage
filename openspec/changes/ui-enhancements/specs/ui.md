# UI Enhancements Implementation

## Overview
Implement requested UI enhancement features including tab modularity, image management, and text animations.

## COMPLETED Requirements

### Tab Modularity System
The application shall support multiple document tabs with modular management.

#### Scenario: Opening multiple documents
Given the editor is active
When user opens a second document
Then a new tab is created for the document
And tabs are switchable

#### Scenario: Modular tab extensions
Given the tab system exists
When a plugin registers tab functionality
Then custom tabs can be added dynamically

## COMPLETED Requirements

### Image Management System
The application already includes basic image overlay and a gadget (Images) backed by images.js. Extend capabilities and editor integration.

#### Scenario: Inserting images via URL
Given Images gadget is open
When user provides image URL and clicks "URL追加"
Then image is added to overlay and persisted for current document
And Markdown export replaces asset placeholders with data URLs

#### Scenario: Paste or drag-and-drop image
Given editor overlay is active
When user pastes or drops an image file
Then image is captured and rendered in overlay
And appears in the Images gadget list

#### Scenario: Image gallery management
Given images exist
When user opens Images gadget
Then images are listed with thumbnails
And user can remove images and overlay updates immediately
And user can edit image properties (alt, width, alignment)

### Text Animation System
The application shall support text animations for storytelling.

#### Scenario: Typing animation
Given text content exists with [type]text[/type] tags
When text is rendered in overlay
Then text appears with typewriter effect and blinking cursor

#### Scenario: Fade animations
Given text sections exist with [fade]text[/fade] tags
When text is rendered in overlay
Then sections fade in smoothly over 1.5 seconds

#### Scenario: Slide animations
Given text sections exist with [slide]text[/slide] tags
When text is rendered in overlay
Then sections slide in from left over 1 second
